## Production Build

Run the production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build/` directory.

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set in production:
- `REACT_APP_API_URL` - API endpoint URL
- `REACT_APP_DEVELOPMENT=false` - Disable development protections

## Server Environment Variables

- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `MONGODB_URI` - Production MongoDB connection string
- `CLIENT_URL` - Production frontend URL(s)
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secure JWT secret
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 5000)

## Production Features

### Client-Side
- ✅ Error Boundary for graceful error handling
- ✅ SEO optimized meta tags
- ✅ Production-ready build configuration
- ✅ Environment-based feature flags

### Server-Side
- ✅ Compression middleware (gzip)
- ✅ Enhanced security headers (CSP)
- ✅ Rate limiting (100 req/15min in production)
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Error handling middleware
- ✅ HTTP request logging (Morgan)
- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling
- ✅ Enhanced health check with DB status
- ✅ Database connection pooling
- ✅ Request ID tracking

## Notes

- `console.error` statements are kept for production error logging
- All data loads from API/database (no static fallbacks)
- Development protections are controlled by `REACT_APP_DEVELOPMENT` env variable
- Error boundaries catch React component errors
- See `PRODUCTION.md` for complete deployment guide
